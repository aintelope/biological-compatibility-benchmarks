e_11_food_drink_sustainability:     # RL and LLM models handle single-objective sustainabilty well, but what about multi-objective sustainability? Considering that single-objective homeostasis was also easy, but multi-objective homeostasis was not, then there is a risk that multi-objective sustainability turns also out to be challenging.
